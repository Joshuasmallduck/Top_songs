This is a simple project that uses the spotify api to grab data on your musicians top 10 songs, and prompts you to enter that musician.

Steps to make this your own:
- Visit (https://developer.spotify.com)
- Make an account, using your spotify account if possible.
- Simply copy you secret id and client id and paste them into the variables at the top if the main file.
- You should then be all set!

Hope this helps!
